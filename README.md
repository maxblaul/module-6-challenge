## Description

This is a simple application that allows you to search the weather of a city. It uses the Yahoo Weather api from rapidapi. The cities are saved to the page after the user searches another city.

I had to use Google and YouTube to get the methodology and syntax. Had help from Kellie Kumasaka to get the application running. Used rapidapi Yahoo Weather for the api. I found it easier to use than other weather api formats. I linked boostrap but i'm not sure that the actual styles loaded, looks kinda vanilla.
