# module-6-challenge
repo for challenge 6


I don't know what I did or did not do but it is still not working. It looks like i did everything i was supposed to but when i open the console It says my Jquery may not have been linked right? And also my API key that I registered a few days ago is STILL not working. Not sure what to do at this point so I'm just going to turn it in and get the grade that I get.
